# kNNExample

This repository is an attempt to implement a naive k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm (O(n^2)), it is hopefully a lead into a more practical version of the kNN algorithm applied to high-dimensional biological data.  There is one R script that contains the implementation of this program, and then pdfs of the output on a simulated dataset based on multiple values of k.
