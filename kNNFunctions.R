  ## norm from the unclassified point of interest to every classified point.  Since we calculate these values in our KNN implementation, 
  ## I believe this has less-than-ideal computational complexity, so I have labelled this a naive implementation.  It is still "fast 
  ## enough" for the datasets we consider (the ~6400 iterations of it in each nested loop using 200 data points takes about 6 seconds).

    ## is the l1 or taxicab norm.

    ## function, we could have implemented other distance measures as well, but I think these are the most common numeric vector norms, and
    ## also the most relevant for my purposes.
